# Bolt-Hackathon-Submission
NFL Elite Trainer is an AI-powered web app that generates position-specific football workouts based on NFL combine data and player goals.


## Project Objective 
NFL Elite Trainer is an AI-powered web application that generates realistic, position-specific workouts for American football athletes based on NFL combine standards and training science. The app uses OpenAI's GPT via Bolt.new to simulate ML logic for evaluating workout efficiency, delivering both a customized training plan and a smart performance score.

It also features a static quarterback-focused dashboard for qbs to look to a ideal workout of a top performing qb, UI prototype and offers a clean, responsive design with dark/light mode support — optimized for athletes, trainers, and football enthusiasts aiming to train like the pros.


## Features ⚙️ 

🏋️‍♂️ Position-Specific Training Generator
Supports major NFL positions: QB, RB, WR, OL, etc.

Training goals: Strength, Speed, Agility, Recovery

Workouts are grounded in combine-style and field drills

📊 AI-Simulated Efficiency Score
  Gives each workout a score out of 100 , simulates a ML model.

Factors include: exercise balance, intensity, position fit, and injury prevention

Short, actionable feedback included with each score

📈 Static Dashboard (Quarterback Example)
Prebuilt dashboard view showing mock weekly training data for QBS , gives the ideal metric for where QBS need to be at in their performance.

Charts for training volume, focus distribution, and performance trends

Designed for future dynamic data integration

🌙 Clean UI/UX
Gradient dark purple theme

Light/dark mode toggle

Mobile responsive, fast-loading UI built with TailwindCSS

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Build fully with Bolt.new for Bolt hackathon. Used Figma to build a wire frame of my project.

## Challenges Faced 
Simulating intelligent ML behavior using  prompts within token limits

Designing scoring logic that felt realistic and consistent across positions

Working around Bolt’s UI constraints to simulate data persistence

Creating a pro-grade UI/UX inside a constrained tool environment

## Insights & Learnings

Real-world sports applications require blending general domain level knowledge of the sport + AI logic.

Custom UI/UX matters for user trust in performance-focused tools.

🔮 What's Next

Expand the dashboard to support all positions with real-time analytics

Implement , training load tracking, and progress forecasting for players , have real time NFL data as well through APIS.
